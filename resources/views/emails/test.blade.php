        <p>Hello there ðŸ‘‹,</p>
        <p>Thank you for registering on this platform.</p>
        <p>This application was developed entirely by me as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project. I designed and built everything from scratch to practice and demonstrate my programming skills.</p>
        <p>Feel free to explore the features like managing transactions, visualizing reports, and more.</p>
        <p>If you have any feedback or ideas, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Best wishes,<br><strong>Esra KarakaÅŸ</strong></p>
